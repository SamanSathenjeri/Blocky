# ![Blocky Logo](./images/fullLogo.png) Blocky

**Blocky** is an open-source Chrome extension designed to protect you from popups, forced redirects, and malicious ads while browsing the web. It uses behavioral detection to block unwanted popups and redirect chains, and gives you the ability to toggle protection on or off at any time.

- **Gesture-Aware**: Only allows popups or redirects triggered by actual user interactions.
